# Item Lending API — Backend Evolution

## 📌 About This Project
This repository represents **Phase 2** of the *Item Lending API* project.

The purpose of this phase is to **evolve a well-structured backend API into a production-oriented application**, focusing on persistence, validation, documentation and architectural maturity.

The project continues to use a simple domain on purpose, allowing the learning process to focus on **backend fundamentals and real-world practices**, not business complexity.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (Phase 2)
- Integrate a relational database (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Replace in-memory persistence with database repositories
- Implement database migrations and schema versioning
- Add request validation using schemas
- Centralize error handling with a global error handler
- Document the API using Swagger / OpenAPI
- Strengthen backend architecture for real-world scenarios

## 🧱 Architecture
The project maintains a **layered architecture**, allowing the application to evolve without major refactors:
